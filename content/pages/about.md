Hi there, My name's Long. I'm a software engineer base in **Da Nang, Vietnam**. Currently, I'm working full-time for an awesome company named [NFQ Asia](https://www.nfq.asia/).
I build front-end UIs with  **React**, **Vuejs**, **Nuxt.js**, **Next.js**. A couple years ago it was *Angular 1.x*. My daily jobs also invoke into back-end tasks. In back-end we use **Node.js**, **PHP** and **Java**.

This blog contains my research while working. Most of the posts are about **HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React** and with a few other random things thrown in.
 
My interest in web development and developing engaging user interfaces is what drove me to specialise in Frontend Development.

## What I Do

I offer frontend solutions, making using of cutting edge technologies. I like mobile-first responsive design, progressive enhancement and single page applications.
I find the process of shaping an online identity through engaging user interaction fascinating.
